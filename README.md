"# Heart-Diseases-Prediction" 
The Heart Diseases Prediction project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on key medical attributes.
It leverages data-driven insights and classification algorithms to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and preventive treatment.
Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM are trained and evaluated for accuracy.
Data preprocessing, visualization, and model training are done using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib).
The model helps in early diagnosis and supports doctors in medical decision-making.
Future scope includes deploying the system with a Flask or Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
